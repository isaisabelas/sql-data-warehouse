# Data Warehouse & Analytics 

This project consists on a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, all the way from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. 
Done while following [Data WithBaraa](https://github.com/DataWithBaraa)'s class. My goal is to understand the principles of how an end to end ELT/ELT process works, along with best practices for building data projects.

 ### Data Architecture
The data architecture of this project follows the Medallion framework with three layers:
1 - Bronze Layer: Holds the raw data extracted from source systems, ingested from CSV files into SQL Server.
2 - Silver Layer: Focuses on data cleaning, standardization, and normalization to make the information ready for analysis.
3 - Gold Layer: Contains business-ready data, structured in a star schema to support reporting and analytics.

### Project Requirements 
*Goal* 
Build a modern Data Warehouse with SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision making.

- *Integration*: Combine both sources (CRM and ERP) into a single, user friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
